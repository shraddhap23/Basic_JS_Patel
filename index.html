		<ul>
			<li><strong>Variables</strong> - A variable can be equivalent to any data type. It is a container for a value and the var has to be defined. Variables aka "var" make it easy to group things. </li>
			
			<li><strong>Debugging (alerts, comments, the console)</strong> - 
			<br>Alerts: These are pop-ups that come up as soon as the alert() function gets called. 
			<br>Comments: To write comments in javascript and jquery, use "//" before the comment (single line) and use "*/" closed with a "/" for multiline commenting.
			<br>The Console: This is a built-in tool in the browser where you can run JavaScript code directly. It also allows you to see the output of JavaScript that has been written. To do this use "console.log" and whatever you want displayed in parentheses.
			</li>
			
			<li><strong>Arrays</strong> - Arrays hold a collection of data and of any data type. You can retrieve items inside of an array through using their indices (note: first item always has an index of 0). An array can store other arrays. </li>
			
			<li><strong>Different data types</strong> - 
			<br>Objects: Like an array but you can define the keys
			<br>Strings: "Hello my name is Shraddha"
			<br>Numbers: 1, 2, 3, 4, etc
			<br>Boolean: True or False
			<br>Undefined: Has no value
			</li>

			<li><strong>Testing</strong> - Any test returns a boolean (True or False. To test if two stings are equal use "==" but to also check whether the object type use "===" to test if they are not equal use "!==" and for great than, less than and equal to or more/less use <,>,<=,>=. </li>
			
			<li><strong>Logic</strong> - This is the control flow of your program which allows the computer to do math (literally and figuratively). Logic is using the if/else statements.</li>
			
			<li><strong>Functions</strong> - Functions help group code to use later. It can take arguments, these are used as variables inside the function. The function usually returns a value which can either be used later or displayed immediately.</li>
